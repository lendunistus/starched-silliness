# starchedsilliness-assets
This repository contains assets (models, popfiles, sounds, maps, etc) from the 2021 April Fools TF2 MVM campaign "Starched Silliness".

I received these from the pineapple.tf support email. As far as I'm aware, these have not been made available for download anywhere else, so I'm making them available here.

(rafmod)[https://github.com/ramirez-tf2/Rafmod] is required to run these missions. As such, the server must be running on a Linux machine. A dedicated server is not required; a listen server will do the job.

If you need help setting this up on a dedicated server, feel free to reach out on Discord at lendun#3916 (although I do not guarantee in the slightest that I can fix your problem).

I do not own nor have I made these assets. Credit goes to the respective creators of every map, model, popfile, sound, etc in this repository. If you have any issues with your content being made available here, contact me and I'll take it down.

Thanks.
